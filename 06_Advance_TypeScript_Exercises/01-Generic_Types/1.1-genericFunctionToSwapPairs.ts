/*
 * Generic types allow functions, classes, and interfaces to work with multiple types
 * while retaining type information. They enable the creation of reusable and type-safe
 * components by using type variables, such as <T>, to stand in for any type. This ensures
 * flexibility without losing type safety, as the specific type is determined at the time
 * of invocation or instantiation, and is enforced by the TypeScript compiler.
