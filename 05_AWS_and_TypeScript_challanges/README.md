# AWS Development Environment Setup

> This guide will help you set up your development environment to work with AWS services, including DynamoDB and Lambda Functions, using TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

* Node.js (v14.x or later)

* AWS Account

## Step 1: Install AWS CLI

First, you'll need to install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). Follow the instructions for your operating system on the official AWS CLI installation page.

## Step 2: Configure AWS CLI

Once the AWS CLI is installed, you'll need to configure it with your AWS credentials. Open a terminal and run:

`aws configure`

You'll be prompted to enter your `AWS Access Key ID`, `Secret Access Key`, `default region`, and `default output format`. You can find these details in your AWS Management Console.

## Step 3: Install AWS SDK

You'll need the AWS SDK to interact with AWS services programmatically. In your project directory, run:

`npm install aws-sdk`

## Step 4: Install TypeScript and AWS SDK Type Definitions

Since you'll be working with TypeScript, you'll need to install TypeScript and the type definitions for the AWS SDK. Run:

`npm install typescript @types/node @types/aws-sdk`

## Step 5: Set Up Your TypeScript Project

Create a `tsconfig.json` file in your project directory with the following content:

```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

## Step 6: Write and Deploy Your Code

You can now write your TypeScript code to interact with AWS services like DynamoDB and Lambda. Refer to the AWS SDK documentation for examples and API details.

To compile your TypeScript code, run:

`tsc --watch`

To deploy your code to AWS, you can use the AWS CLI, AWS CloudFormation, or other deployment tools like the Serverless Framework.

## Conclusion

You're now ready to start working on AWS projects using TypeScript. Follow best practices, refer to the official AWS documentation, and happy coding!
